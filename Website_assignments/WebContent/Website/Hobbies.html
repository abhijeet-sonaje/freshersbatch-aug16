			<td colspan="5"><img src="paint.png" class="img1"/><p>Painting is not just for the professional.  Painting can be a pastime or a hobby too; and pursued for the satisfaction of simply trying something one has always wondered whether or not they could do.   There is nothing wrong with being an amateur at painting.  It is a beginning. Many professionals were once amateurs.</p><p>Painting attracts so many people today of all ages.  I think most people like the idea of painting something of beauty and feeling good about being able to say they painted it.  Painting as a hobby can be relaxing in a stress filled life.  It can be an escape into another world, a world of calm. Anyone can pick painting up as a hobby and enjoy it.  One will not find themself dealing with boredom when taking up painting.   Plus, they can do a painting and even give it as a gift</p> </td>
